# MATLAB code and raw data mzXML for Variation in chemical composition of dissolved organic matter during the winter to spring transition in the northern Barents Sea 
 Seawater samples were collected during early winter (December 2019), late winter (March 2021) and spring (May 2021) on the transect in the northern Barents Sea and into the Nansen Basin (76°N – 83°N) as part of The Nansen Legacy (RCN # 276730). Samples were analyzed for molecular analysis of dissolved organic matter using Orbitrap-Mass spectrometer. The raw data and matlab code used to processed the mass spectrometry data and generate figures for publication. 
samplenamesAeNMS.xlsx is used for adding ancillary data from the Nansen Legacy project to make figures. Metadata_AEN_2024 contains the DOM dmetric values (Molecular weight, molecular ratios etc.) in addition to SPE-DOC and DOC values.

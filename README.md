# MATLAB code and raw data mzXML for Variation in chemical composition of dissolved organic matter during the winter to spring transition in the northern Barents Sea 
 A total of 89 seawater samples were collected during early winter (December 2019), late winter (March 2021) and spring (May 2021) on the transect in the northern Barents Sea and into the Nansen Basin (76°N – 83°N) as part of the Nansen Legacy Project. Samples were analyzed for molecular analysis of dissolved organic matter using Orbitrap-Mass spectrometer. The raw data and matlab code used to processthe mass spectrometry data and generate figures for publication.
